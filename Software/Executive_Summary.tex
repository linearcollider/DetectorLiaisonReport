\subsection{Executive Summary}

The software developed for the linear collider concepts is a demonstration of the successful collaboration between different concept groups. Starting from the cooperation on LCIO between SiD and ILD, seeded at SLAC and DESY, respectively, the linear collider community developed software and tools that underpins a diverse detector R\&D program, several large detector simulation study campaigns that led to a couple of multiple documents, and physics studies that have resulted in several publications in peer-reviewed journals and many notes.

Concepts that originated in LC software have found their way into software for several non-LC experiments:
\begin{itemize}
 	\item The LCIO EDM is being used for studies of Future Circular Colliders.
	\item The XML geometry description developed in LCDD is being used by DD4HEP, which is now being considered by LHCb for their simulation needs.
	\item The PandoraPFA package is being used for event reconstruction of neutrino scattering in a liquid argon TPC by the MicroBooNE collaboration
\end{itemize}

All packages described in this document are published under open source licenses.
