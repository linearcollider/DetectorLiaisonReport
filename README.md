This is the source code for the Linear Collider detector R&D liaison summary document.
For suggestions, updates and comments, please use the issue tracker.

The easiest way to contribute is to:
 - make an account on github and fork this repository (use the fork button in the top left corner)
 - get an account on overleaf.com and import the github repository there
    - (change the settings to use LuaLaTeX)
- comment out all of the other subdetectors (otherwise the document will not compile)
- make the desired changes to your subsection
- sync the overleaf document back to your github repository
    - This will trigger a build of the document. If you want to see the pdf file again, make a "release" of your repository. This will attach the pdf if everything works fine
- if there are no errors in the pdf, make a pull request against this repository. We will review the changes and add them to the main document
