        The main option for the sensitive elements will be plastic scintillation strips/ wavelength shifter fiber/Silicon Photomultiplier.
        The signals will readout from both sides of the scintillation strip offers the possibility to define the position of the hits along the scintillation strip, which will help in reducing the fake rate in the stereolayer geometry of muon system. &
\begin{enumerate}
\item Detailed Monte Carlo Simulation of the Muon/Tail Catcher System, for optimization of layout and performance.
\item Study of the performance of the Muon System/Tail Catcher with framework of PFA, especially for the recovery of the energy leackage from hadron calorimeter. 
\item Optimization of the detection elements of the Muon System/Tail Catcher. The first priority is the design of the main detection elements a scintillation strips, wavelength shifter fiber with the SiPM readout,
\item Development of the Digital options of the SiPM for the Muon /Tail Catcher Detection System, which will dramatically simplify the readout electronics and data processing.
\end{enumerate} &
