\section*{Linear Collider Detector R\&D Liaison Charge, as defined by the Linear Collider
Collaboration (LCC) Physics and Detector Executive Board Mandate (2014-2020):}
The LC Detector R\&D Liaisons ensure productive communication between the Linear
Collider Collaboration (LCC) Physics and Detectors Executive Board and the detector R\&D
groups. The liaisons are in contact with all individual detector R\&D groups relevant to linear
colliders to keep track of the overall detector R\&D activities conducted or planned for linear
colliders and to periodically compile summaries of the efforts. The report is not intended to
serve as the summary to select between different technologies or advertise the most
advanced ones, but rather as the general overview of the Linear Colliders Detector R\&D
landscape.


\section*{Introduction}
The physics goals of high-luminosity particle accelerators, from LHC to the High-
Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) and to the
next generation of lepton colliders, have set quite stringent constraints on the future needs at
the Instrumentation Frontier. Many technologies are reaching their sensitivity limit and new
approaches need to be developed to overcome the currently irreducible technological
challenges. The detrimental effects of material budget and power consumption present
a very serious concern for high-precision silicon vertex and tracking detectors. One of the
most promising areas is CMOS sensors, which offer low mass and potentially radiation-hard
technology for future proton--proton and electron--positron colliders, intensity frontier and
heavy-ion experiments. MPGDs have become a well-established technology in the fertile field
of gaseous detectors; these will remain the primary choice, whenever large-area
coverage with low material budget is required. Vacuum tube technology is inherently fast and
new developments include advances in micro-channel plates for photomultipliers with a
potential for picosecond-time resolution in large systems. Several novel concepts of
picosecond-timing detectors will have numerous powerful applications in particle
identification, pile-up rejection and event reconstruction, and serve numerous scientific goals.
The story of modern calorimetry is a textbook example of physics research driving the
development of an experimental method. Silicon photomultipliers have seen a rapid progress
in the last decade, becoming the standard solution for scintillator-based devices. The
integration of advanced electronics and data transmission functionalities plays an
increasingly important role and needs to be addressed. Future experimental projects also
face a large number of diverse engineering challenges, in the areas of system integration,
power distribution, cooling, mechanical support structures, and production techniques.
Bringing the modern algorithmic advances from the field of machine learning from offline
applications to online operations and trigger systems is another major challenge. The
timescales spanned by future projects in particle physics, ranging from few years to many
decades, constitute a challenge in itself, in addition to the complexity and diversity of the
required accelerator and detector R\&D.

The landscape of proposed future accelerator facilities is broad in terms of detector
technologies to address the physics programs. At the Energy Frontier one can distinguish
two major drivers for detector R\&D in the short term: detector upgrades toward HL-LHC
and development of advanced technologies for future $\mathrm{e}^{+}\mathrm{e}^{-}$
linear colliders (ILC, CLIC). The latter are inherently very accurate physics probes requiring
integrated concepts with ultimate precision, minimal power consumption and ultra-light
structures. A key challenge to demonstrate the required detector performance in a realistic
environment represents a major step forward toward a complete system. Fast and accurate
physics-driven detector simulations have gained considerable importance with the increase of
the complexity of novel instrumentation. Concerning synergies and challenges in the design
and instrumentation developments for the ILC and CLIC (and future circular lepton collider)
experiments, these are in most cases orthogonal to the main directions of HL-LHC
experiments. Rather than emphasizing radiation hardness and rate capability, the demands
for resolution (granularity) and material budget on one hand, and for acceptable speed and
low power consumption on the other hand, exceed significantly what is the state-of-the-art today.
Such leaps in performance cannot be achieved by simple extrapolation of the known, but
only by entering new technological territory in detector R\&D. Several new concepts for silicon
sensor integration, such as monolithic devices, are being pursued for pixel vertex detectors,
new micro-pattern gas amplification techniques are under study for tracking and muon systems,
and the particle-flow approach to calorimetry promises to deliver unprecedented jet energy
resolution, to name just some examples.

Emerging novel detector technologies are the vital backbone for the success of the
upcoming large and complex particle physics experiments. They are usually the result of a
long development cycle encompassing many stages: generic ``blue-sky'' R\&D and R\&D
activities guided by the needs of future projects, focused R\&D activities for an approved
experiment, production, industrialization and installation/commissioning, where engineering
aspects play a very important role. On average, it might take more than 20 years to mature a
technology from the original idea to a well-established technique suited for implementation
(e.g.\ the first workshop on the LHC was held in 1984).

Over the past few decades, a large number of groups have pursued extensive generic
detector R\&D studies, summarized in this report, applicable to any of the proposed Linear
Collider detector concepts (International Large Detector (ILD), Silicon Detector (SiD) and
CLIC Detector and Physics (CLICdp). Intentionally, these groups did not yet make very
specific choices and keep various options for technologies to realise the individual sub-
detectors. This has the advantage that the technologies can be further developed until
specific choices have to made, once the project is approved. Furthermore---and as important---this
keeps a broad community of detector research groups at universities and laboratories
involved and increases the chance to arrive at the best technically possible detector solution
when it has to be built. Wherever possible, the R\&D is not pursued with respect to one
specific concept but in the context of world-wide transversal R\&D collaborations which work
on technologies rather than detector designs, such as CALICE, LCTPC, and FCAL. Further
R\&D programs are ongoing, e.g.\ for various monolithic pixel detector technologies
(CMOS, DEPFET, FPCCD, SoI), for generic aspects of the next generation silicon vertex
detectors for Linear Colliders and for the development of forward calorimetry. Last, but not
least, European Commission-funded programs, such as EUDET, AIDA/AIDA2020 and
ATTRACT play an important role in enabling and supporting generic R\&D activities.
This report provides an overview of the past and presently ongoing Linear Collider
detector R\&D studies, including those not directly included in the ILD, SiD and CLICdp
concept groups today, but which might become relevant in the future. The main purpose of
the document is to summarize recent progress, followed by the description of future
milestones, with the following goals:
\begin{itemize}
	\item ``Publicize'' particular technology and to provide an update of the recent R\&D efforts
since the Conceptual Design Report (CDR) for CLIC and the Detailed Baseline
Design (DBD) for the ILC;
	\item Provide a ``snapshot'' for a given technology, without information on manpower needs
and financial resources to reach project milestones. As most detector R\&D groups
are highly independent with their own funds, this document is not intended to serve
as a guideline to control or coordinate different R\&D efforts, by indicating potential
overlap areas;
	\item Provide an entry point for new groups in order to help them learn about the current
landscape of LC R\&D efforts and the areas where they might be interested to
contribute.
\end{itemize}
Therefore, each individual R\&D group within the Linear Collider community was asked to
submit a short document answering five questions in relation to their R\&D program, as an
input to the Linear Collider Detector R\&D Liaison report. These are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Introduction. Brief overview of the technology (past R\&D efforts with references);
	\item Recent milestones since ILC DBD and CLIC CDR publications;
	\item Engineering challenges for a given detector technology in order to encourage new
groups to contribute to the engineering aspects and not only to the generic R\&D;
	\item Future plans in the years to come and the list of collaborating institutes;
	\item R\&D spin-offs beyond the ILC, if technology has been already used in other projects.
\end{itemize}
The LC Detector R\&D Liaison report served as an online documentation, updated on a
regular basis and available to community and newcomers, during the LCC Physics and
Detector Executive Board mandate (2014-2020).

In particular, version 2018.3 (released December 17, 2018) was used as one of the main
LCC supporting documents presented to the European Strategy Process:
\url{https://ilchome.web.cern.ch/content/ilc-european-strategy-document.html}
This version represents the final release of the Linear Collider Detector R\&D report at the
end of the LCC mandate. It is intended to serve as one of the inputs to the US Snowmass
process: \url{https://snowmass21.org/}.
