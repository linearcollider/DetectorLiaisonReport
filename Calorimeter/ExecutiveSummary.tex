\subsubsection{The AHCAL in ILD and SiD}
The AHCAL prototype development follows the ILD detector design, and the performance studies, which guide the R\&D, are performed in the ILD concept. The detailed AHCAL simulation, as implemented in the ILD, has been shown to reproduce test beam results, and the components realized in prototypes are represented in the engineering model of ILD. There is close consultation between CALICE and the concepts on prioritizing the R\&D which is still needed on the way to a realistic technical proposal.

The AHCAL also constitutes an option for the hadronic calorimeter of the SiD concept. It is straightforward to transfer the technical and integration solutions developed in the ILD context to SiD, because the basic geometry and the routing of signals are very similar. However, the detailed integration of the AHCAL in the engineering model and in the simulation is not yet as advanced as for ILD. For example, the optimization of the cell size still needs to be done for the SiD case with its smaller detector radius and the more finely segmented ECAL. Steps are being taken on the software side, but the engineering support is sub-critical. There is regular exchange between CALICE and SiD on these issues, both the conceptual as well as on the technical level.
